### Notes

* Lecture 1-15. Comprehensive course notes covering fundamental concepts and algorithms in image processing and visualization. The curriculum includes: digital image formation and representation, intensity transformations and histogram processing (global and local histogram equalization), thresholding methods (basic global thresholding, Otsu algorithm, entropy-based thresholding, and locally adaptive thresholding), spatial domain filtering (convolution, smoothing with Gaussian filters, sharpening with Laplacian operators, and edge detection), frequency domain transformation and filtering (Fourier transform, sampling theorem, frequency domain filtering pipeline, low-pass and high-pass filters), noise models and image restoration (noise generation, notch filtering, Wiener filtering), image segmentation (K-means clustering, Gaussian Mixture Model with EM algorithm, morphological operations including erosion, dilation, opening, and closing), spatial transformations and image registration (interpolation methods, Free-Form Deformation using cubic B-splines, local affine transformations, forward and backward transformations), and three-dimensional volume visualization (isosurface extraction using Marching Cubes, direct volume rendering with ray casting and splatting, Blinn-Phong illumination models, and gradient computation for surface normals).

* Pseudocode. Algorithm pseudocode collection that not only aids in understanding the fundamental algorithms covered in the course but also constitutes a significant portion of the final examination. The pseudocode includes step-by-step implementations of 35 core algorithms ranging from basic image transformations to advanced rendering techniques.
